Those twoo threat are dangerous and can put you at risk, however there is a way to protect yourself from those. First of, when you are browsing website on the internet,
you need to be sure that the website is secure by having **HTTPS** and not **HTTP**, and be sure what kind of information you are willing to share (mail, password...) most
of the normal users do not change their password wich is very dangerous... 

However, if you found out that you are victim from a phishing attack, you need to changes the informations used against you (mailbox password, account on a website...), in the case that it is
your credit card wich is used, you need to contact your bank and ask them to **delete your credit card** and get a new one.
