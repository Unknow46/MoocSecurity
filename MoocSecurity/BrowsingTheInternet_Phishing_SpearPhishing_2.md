The fact that hackers are able to collect that much data on you can create a more dangerous threat, which is known in that case by a **Spear Phishing** attack.
That attack is much more dangerous that the previous one, because, it is nearly impossible to identify it, due to the fact that it had large amount of information on the victim.

Those large amount of information is due to the fact that an hacker has been able to stay for mounths in the mailbox of the victim for exemple.
That threat is not only dangerous for you but can be also for your work if you receive also mail on your personnal mailbox.
