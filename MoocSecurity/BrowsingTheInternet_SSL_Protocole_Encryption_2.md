SSL is the standard in online security.  It is used to encrypt data sent over the Internet between a client (your computer) and a server (a website's computer),
normally if a hacker intercepts encrypted data, the hacker can't read it or use it without the private decryption key.

However, assaults on trust through the SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic are now common and growing in frequency, SSL can be intercepted, either for legitimate or illegitimate reasons.
Interception is achieved through the use of "middleboxes," which are between the website and the client's machine.
These middleboxes have proxy software that can delete and restart the SSL connection, allowing a middleman access to private information.  
This SSL certificate vulnerability can be avoided by using strict SSL.
