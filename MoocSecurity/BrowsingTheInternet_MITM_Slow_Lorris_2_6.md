## Communication trust

The problems using communication system is that, sometimes, it can be used against us.

### How ?

Sometimes when we want to access a new website and create a new account, we need to give our email address, and enter
a new password, and we used without thinking the same password over and over again... Which is a problem here.

When we encounter a malicious website, it can exploit our email account sometimes without us knowing it, and searching
for precious information, Those information leaked can be anything, its even worse when its related to the company of
the users...

### Why ?

Those data are considerated precious in the dark web, and is exchanged for money.

### How to protect ourself ?

The first thing to do is to be sure to use a different password for our account on website and email, and use a strict 
password in any case (Password, number, special character...).
