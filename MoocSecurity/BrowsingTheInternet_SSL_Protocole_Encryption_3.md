## Protocol Encryption

Encryption is an interesting piece of technology that works by scrambling data so it is unreadable by unintended parties.
We can find it in mails for exemple, but encrypted data are not fully protected.

The list below contains most of the famous encryption protocol we know :
- **3DES** : Triple Data Encryption Algortihm
- **AES | AES256** (successor of 3DES) : Advanced Encryption Standard
- **RSA** : Rivest Shamir Adleman

In the list above the most secure encryption protocol of today is AES256 would take billions of years to break using current computing technology. 
Hackers would be foolish to even attempt this type of attack, Nevertheless, no **encryption system** is entirely secure.

That is why when you are browsing the internet, you should always think twice on what you are willing to share with others, you do not know if someone will be able to
intercept your data and decrypt it.
