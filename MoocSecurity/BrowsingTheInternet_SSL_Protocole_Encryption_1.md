## SSL/TLS 

Before we start lets make a quick review on SSL and TLS :

- **SSL** : Secure Sockets Layer
- **TLS** : Transport Layer Security

they are both protocols used to send data online securely. SSL is older than TLS, but all SSL certificates can use both SSL and TLS encryption.

Now that we know what their purpose is, let's take a look at the type of vulnerability they have.
