### DDos

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is when an attacker, or attackers, attempt to make it impossible for a service to be
delivered. This can be achieved by thwarting access to virtually anything: 

- servers, 
- devices, 
- services, 
- networks.. 

and even specific transactions within applications. In a DoS attack, 
itâ€™s one system that is sending the malicious data or requests; a DDoS attack comes from multiple systems.
