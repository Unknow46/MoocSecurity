## Server vulnerability / Communication vulnerability

We saw before while browsing the internet, that it is possible to have data stolen or server having vulnerability, but, what are the cause ?

### MITM

**man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)** is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications 
between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other. One example of a MITM attack is active
**eavesdropping**, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them 
believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.

A MITM attack is generally used to rondabout a safe access point to make a false one. When a users connected to it, a hackers can see what he's doing.
The dangerous part of that attack is that the users do not know that even on a HTTPS website the hackers can see what he is doing.
