## Phishing and Spear Phishing

The goal of this part of the MOOC is to make you realize how dangerous it can be to answer a mail you do not know the origin of, and browsing website on internet.
Those fake mails are known as **phishing**, their goals is to collect your data just by clicking on a link sometimes...
However, you do not need to receive a mail to be a victim of a **phishing** when you are visiting a website for the first time which is not **HTTPS**
you do not know if any information you enter on that website is collected (password, mail, adress...), wich is used by hackers to collect more data on you.
